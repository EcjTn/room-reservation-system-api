## 🚀 Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Spring Boot**: Handles HTTP requests and manages application components for a robust API framework.
- **Spring Security**: Secures the API endpoints with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies database interactions and provides an abstraction layer over Hibernate.
- **Spring Session Redis**: Manages user sessions efficiently, allowing for scalable session handling.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores reservation data reliably with strong data integrity.
- **Redis**: Caches frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce load.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Vertical Slice Architecture**: Organizes features into modular slices with all necessary components per functionality.
